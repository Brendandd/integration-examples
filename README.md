# Integration Examples

The integration engine currently includes four example routes. Refer to the route classes in each example to see which components are used and how they are configured. Each example is implemented as a Spring Boot application.

Please refer to the Integration module for detailed setup instructions.

<ol>
    <li>hl7-file-input-route</li>
    <li>hl7-file-output-route</li>
    <li>mllp-input-route</li>
    <li>mllp-output-route</li>
</ol>




Unit tests still need to be written.
